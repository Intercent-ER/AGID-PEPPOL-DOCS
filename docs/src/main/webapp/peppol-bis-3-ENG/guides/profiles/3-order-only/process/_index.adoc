The Order only profile includes the sending of Orders from a Buyer to a Seller.

[[process-flow]]
== Process flow

The Order process flow can be described as follows:

* A Buyer submits an Order to the Seller requesting for delivery of goods or services
* An Order may refer to a framework agreement for its terms and conditions; otherwise the Buyerâ€™s terms and conditions apply.
* An Order may contain items (goods or services) with item identifiers or items with free text description.

== #Business processes requirements#

The Seller is not obliged to transmit the Response, unless otherwise provided for by regulations, commercial practice or the agreement between the parties.

Therefore, the absence of the Response is equivalent to the Order acceptance. +

In the case of use the Response, see Ordering profile. +
