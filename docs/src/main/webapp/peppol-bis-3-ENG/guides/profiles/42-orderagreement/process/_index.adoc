= Process and typical use cases

The order agreement BIS includes the sending of information on agreed products/services from a Seller to a Buyer.

== Process flow

The order agreement process flow can be described as follows:

.Possible start positions:
. A Buyer makes a purchase of goods or services from the Seller.
. A Seller reports one or more accumulated purchases made under a framework agreement to the Buyer.

.End positions:
. A purchase has been recorded in the Buyer´s purchasing system. The seller proceeds to invoice accordingly.

An Order Agreement may refer to a framework agreement for its terms and conditions; otherwise the Buyer’s terms and conditions apply.



[[Requisiti-dei-processi-di-business]]
== #Business processes requirements#

This process involves the use of two Documents: +

* an *Order agreement*, issued by the Seller;
* a *Confirmation Order*, eventually issued by the Client.

The process starts with the sending of an order agreement from the Seller, who issue it because he is pre-authorized by the Client. +

Following the reception of the Order Agreement, the Client can: +

* conclude the process without issuing a Confirmation Order; +

* transmit a Confirmation Order, that needs to contain the indication of the Order Agreement to which it is related to, for communicating to the Seller that he intends to: +

** confirm the Order Agreement received (Ordine di riscontro per conferma); +

** reject the Order Agreement received (Ordine di riscontro per
diniego);

** replace the Order Agreement received (Ordine di riscontro sostitutivo).
