= Schematron design

As several people are involved in the development of the schematron artefacts, this small guideline has been created in order to align how the schematrons are written/developed.

The design rules have been developed in order to achieve

* reusability
* good performance
* readability for technical and non-technical staff

For further information on the schematron syntax, please refer to http://schematron.com/[the schematron website].
