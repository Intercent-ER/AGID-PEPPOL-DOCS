= The shopping cart line

Each shopping cart line must have an id to support processing and referencing of individual lines . The ID is created by the seller and may be of any structure.

IMPORTANT: A line id must be unique within the shopping cart message, but does not need to be in sequential order in the transaction.

Example of a series of line identifiers is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ... or any other structure.
