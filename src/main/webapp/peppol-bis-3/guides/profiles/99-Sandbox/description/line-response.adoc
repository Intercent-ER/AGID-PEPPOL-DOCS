= Line response

In case of a negative response (rejection), the `cac:LineResponse` element is used to specify the
errors in the business document. The `cbc:LineID` element is mandatory in {ubl}, but not
relevant since the line responses are listing errors on both header level and line level from the
original document and should have the value: *NA* (“Not Applicable”, must be all uppercase). The
`cbc:XPath` element should be used to indicate where in the business document the error occurred
(or other method for non-xml syntaxes) to reference the element causing the error. The
`cbc:Description` element must be expressed in English only.

.Example:
[source, xml, indent=0]
