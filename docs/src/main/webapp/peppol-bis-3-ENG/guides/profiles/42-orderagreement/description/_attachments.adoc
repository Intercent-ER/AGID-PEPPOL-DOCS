= Attachments on header level

Non-XML documents can be sent as attachments to the PEPPOL BIS Order Agreement. This could be time sheets or other documents relevant for the order agreement. The attachment can either be sent as a binary object encoded in Base64 embedded in the message or as a URI to an external address as a link.

It is recommended to send attachments as embedded, binary objects and not as external references.

====
IMPORTANT: Attachments should be used for additional information and not as order copies.

#In the event of goods and services orders that to be processed require necessarily the presence of certain documents (ex. Patient Cars), it is necessary that these documents need to be trasmitted through NSO as an attached PDF to the electronic order.#

#Where the information contained in the attachments may involve privacy issues, these attachments can be in encrypted form or it is possible to use the element *cac:ExternalReference*, which access can be limited to appropriate profiling.#
