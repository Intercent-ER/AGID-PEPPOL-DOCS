= Prices

Prices may be exchanged in the order both for products with or without item identifiers and free text orders.

If prices are not sent in the order the normal process is to do price matching during the billing process comparing prices in the Invoice to prices in the Catalogue.

Price sent is related to the articles or services within this order.

* Prices should include allowances and/or charges but exclude TAX amounts (e.g. VAT, GST or sales tax)
