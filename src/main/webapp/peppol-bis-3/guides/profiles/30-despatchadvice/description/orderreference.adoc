[[order-reference]]
= Order reference

Used to provide a reference to the purchase order on which the Despatch Advice is based.
There may be multiple Despatch Advices to cover one purchase order.
Each Despatch Advice relates to one purchase order.
The reference to Order Line-ID is required in the UBL syntax.
To cater for scenarios where no order line reference exist a dummy value must be applied.
The dummy value must consist of the characters **NA**.

.Example header level
[source, xml, indent=0]

.Example 1 of Line level

include::{snippet-dir}/snippet-30-2.xml[tags=ref-orderline]
----

.Example 2 of Line level

It is also possible to refer to more than one order in one single despatch advice.
In this case there must not be an order reference on header level.
