= Item name and description

Description of a product can be sent in `cac:Item/cbc:Description`.

The Product name is sent in `cac:Item/cbc:Name`.

The Name is preferably short so that it is suitable for use in a order or invoice line or as a heading.
A description allows for longer text that describes the item in detail.
