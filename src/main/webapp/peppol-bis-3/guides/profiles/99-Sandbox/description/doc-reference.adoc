The document reference is used to provide a reference to the envelope of the business document on
which the message level response is based. The message level response message may only cover
exactly one business document. The element
`cac:DocumentResponse/cac:DocumentReference/cbc:ID` MUST contain the instance
identifier of the envelope of the original business document.
