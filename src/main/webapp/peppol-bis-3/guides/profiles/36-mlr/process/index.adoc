[[process-in-general]]
== Process in general
The process starts when a BusinessDocumentSender is preparing an electronic business document
and then sends it. The BusinessDocumentReceiver receives the business document and potentially
validates syntax and business rules.

. *If the BusinessDocumentSender has requested an MLR back, the BusinessDocumentReceiver either:*

.. Validates the business document and based on the result returns either an accept (no fatal
errors) or a reject (fatal errors found)
.. Doesn’t validate the business document and just sends a MLR with a response code
indicating the message is acknowledged.

IMPORTANT: This specification does not prescribe how a request for MLR is made or communicated.

. *If the BusinessDocumentSender hasn’t requested an MLR back, the BusinessDocumentReceiver
either:*

.. Validates the business document and if fatal errors are found, returns a reject.
.. Doesn’t respond with a MLR in case no fatal errors are found.

If a MLR is returned the MLRReceiver must be notified and take appropriate action. If the response is
positive the MLRReceiver may update the status of the business document or simply ignore the MLR.
