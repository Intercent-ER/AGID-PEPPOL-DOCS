= Document structure

The BIS documents in AsciiDoc should be split up in several small files and folders, as this gives more flexibility and possibility for reuse, and it is easier to read/edit.

A good starting point is to add folders for each main chapter in the document, and then one file pr level 2 header. If the chapter is very small, or very large, this off course should be adjusted as you find it suitable.
