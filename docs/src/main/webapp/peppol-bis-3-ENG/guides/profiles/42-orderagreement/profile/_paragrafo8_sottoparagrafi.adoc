The *Endpoint ID* is specified in the document to maintain information about the electronic address of the sender or the receiver and it is used for channeling the documents (delivery) on the Peppol network. +

* *0211* for the VAT number (that will replace compulsorily the temporary code 9906 starting from 15/11/2021);

* *0210* for the Fiscal code, of legal person or entity (that will replace compulsorily the temporary code 9907 starting from 15/11/2021);
